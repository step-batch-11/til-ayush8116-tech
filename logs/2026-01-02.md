# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What *clicked* today?
--> configuring snippets.
--> customising json of deno.
--> if else

- What changed in your understanding?
--> i understood that how can i move some lines using some mathematical logic.
--> i exposed to some possibilities of using mathematical logics.
--> promise.all is doing parallelisation

- What would you explain differently now?
--> shell file is not just for writing single commands in terminal but we can write a full shell script using the loop , if , else.
---

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully? --> ln --> loop --> changing
  directions and velocity inside the p5.

- What would you like to see one more example of? --> parallelisation --> p5 -->
  drawing the shape using the vector concept

- What feels fragile in your understanding? --> rotating the shape --> ln

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

---

--> if ln is linking a file with another file and giving a reference what will
happen to the content of the reference file ? --> how can i work on agnles in p5
?

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

---

--> writing a shell script which will make sure that my files in directories are
pushed ( live ) but adding and commiting is the user's responsibilities.

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because i got exposed to many new possibilities of using
> maths concepts to make cool things on screen on p5 and writing shell script
> using if - else and loop and making the coding shorter by using snippets and
> deno task to create shortcut for command .
